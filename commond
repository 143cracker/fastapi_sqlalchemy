#run application using gunicorn by commond
gunicorn {application:app} -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker

#create backend service file

 sudo systemctl start {fastapi_demo}
 sudo systemctl enable {fastapi_demo}
To verify if everything works run the following command.
 sudo systemctl status {fastapi_demo}


if all okay then check application

#nginx
 sudo apt update
 sudo apt install nginx

 sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/{fastapi_demo}

 sudo systemctl reload nginx





Activate vhost configuration

Add a soft link of the vhost file in the sites-enabled directory.

 $ sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/fastapi_demo /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
Test and reload the configuration

Test the configuration.

 $ sudo nginx -t
Expected output:

 nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
 nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful
Reload Nginx.

 $ sudo systemctl reload nginx
Secure Nginx with an SSL Certificate
An SSL Certificate is used to encrypt the traffic between users and the origin server. It is essential for applications dealing with sensitive data. We will use Let's Encrypt to obtain an SSL Certificate for free. Please make sure you have pointed your domain to the server's public IP.

Install Certbot

 $ sudo apt install -y certbot python3-certbot-nginx
Install Certificate on Nginx

You will be asked to enter your email address when you run the following command. Please enter your email address and leave the rest set as default.

 $ sudo certbot --nginx -d your_domain -d www.your_domain
Verify the Accessibility

You can verify if the SSL Certificate is configured properly or not by opening the following link in your web browser.

 https://your_domain
Test Auto-Renewal

Let's Encrypt certificates are only valid for 90 days, but certbot will handle auto-renewals. You can verify if the auto-renewal works by running the following command:

 $ sudo certbot renew --dry-run
If the above command doesn't throw an error, it means your SSL certificate will be renewed automatically without any issues.
